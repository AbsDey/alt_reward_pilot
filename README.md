Alternating Rewards - Stroop variant (ARS)

Pilot study

Participants go through learning, practice, and baseline blocks of Stroop stimuli. Following this, they go through two types of Stroop blocks:
1. Rewarded blocks — A specific color item is rewarded
2. Unrewarded blocks — No colors/trials are rewarded.

Participants are given 4 cycles of alternating sequences of 1. and 2. above. Reward blocks always start at the begin of the cycle.


Pilot aims to see if there are reward context effects observable through RT and error rate descriptives.
