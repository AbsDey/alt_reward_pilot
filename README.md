Alternating Rewards - Stroop variant (ARS)

Pilot study

Participants go through learning, practice, and baseline blocks of Stroop stimuli. Following this, they go through two types of Stroop blocks:
1. Rewarded blocks — A specific color item is rewarded
2. Unrewarded blocks — No colors/trials are rewarded.

Participants are given 4 cycles of alternating sequences of 1. and 2. above. Reward blocks always start at the begin of the cycle.


Aim: Observe the presence or absence of reward context effects on RT and error rate behavior — **descriptives only**.
